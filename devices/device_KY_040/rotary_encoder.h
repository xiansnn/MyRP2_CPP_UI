/**
 * @brief The rotary encoder is a device used to control a value the can be incremented/decremented by the user.
 * It can be associated with UIControlledIncrementalValue. 
 * 
 * A rotary encoder has two signals: one can be considered as a clock (clk) , the other as the data (dt).
 * 
 * Clock signal is produced by rotating the encoder. Each time a falling edge is generated on the clock, the value on dt gives the direction of the rotation.
 * 
 * Due to the short time between clk and dt, we cannot usually sample the signals. IRQ is more appropriate.
 * 
 * As a UIController, the rotary encoder is associated with a UIModelObject.
 * 
 * The test program for rotary encoder is the one developed for the Switch button with IRQ
